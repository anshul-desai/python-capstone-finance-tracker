# python-capstone-finance-tracker
This project is a personal finance tracker that I have built using all the concepts I have learned in the Python modules of the Gen AI Externship. In this tracker, you'll be able to add expenses with categories, subjects, and amounts as well as view summaries and all your expenses at once.
To run the script, it is simple. The program will prompt you asking what you want to do (1 for add expense, 2 for view all expenses, 3 for view summary, and 4 to exit). From there, it's self-explanatory as you can continuously add expenses with any subject/category and at any point you can view all the expenses so far accrued.
The concepts used in this project include: Conditional statements, loops, string methods, data structures, functions, exceptions, etc
